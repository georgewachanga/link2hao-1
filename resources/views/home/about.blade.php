                <div class="col-md-6"><b>our history</b> </br>
                 <h4>Link2hao began as an idea in the year 2015, owing to the fact that many students strugge to get accomodation
                    off-campus and even end up spending so much time and resources on the same. The idea was actualised on February 2016
                    with the launching of www.link2hao.com website which did not get as much popularity as it did not solve the problem
                    satisfactorily, leading to a series of efforts to put up a better structure that could solve the current needs.
                    ie online booking and reservation of hostels.The new website was launched on 10th July 2016 and is aimed at providing satisfactory
                    sulutions to the everyday arising every day through consistent and continuous upgrading and maintenance.</h4>
